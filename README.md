# Base Browser for Browsertrix

This repository contains the base platform-specific deb files for Browsertrix Crawler builds.

The `.deb` files are placed in platform-specific directories, `linux/amd64` and `linux/arm64` to support
builds for those platforms. Chromium is used for ARM64 while Chrome is used for amd64 builds.
